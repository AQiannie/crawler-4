    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;President Obama, it seems, has confounded congressional Republicans by giving them exactly what they asked for, on the subject of Syria. "Consult Congress!" they bellowed last week, full of constitutional righteousness. "OK, let's have a vote," Obama responded.  Now the cry, from at least one, is "Obama is &lt;em&gt;hiding behind Congress!&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Seems like they're against whatever Obama's for, but that's not exactly a new thing, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the Syria issue is not a cut-and-dried partisan thing, so giving in to the snarky urge in that first paragraph is not totally justified.  There are anti-war Democrats, there are pro-war Democrats, and there are Republicans equally all over the map on the issue.  So it's really a problem with Congress as a whole rather than just one party.  Also, that's not even what I wanted to talk about this Labor Day, so let's just start over, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress -- even in a good year -- barely works.  That can be taken (equally correctly) either as "barely functions" or "barely ever shows up for work."  In a pathetically unproductive year (this Congress is on track to be the least productive Congress since records were kept), this should already have become painfully obvious to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the fact that the inside-the-Beltway conventional wisdom, as late as last Thursday, had not only convinced itself exactly how we were going to strike Syria, but also &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; we were going to attack (the consensus: Obama had to strike before he flies off to St. Petersburg for an international meeting).  As happens with regularity, the inside-the-Beltway consensus was wrong.  President Obama didn't get their memo, or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than discussing the pros and cons of striking Syria today, we have to point out something which should be glaringly obvious &lt;em&gt;even inside the Beltway&lt;/em&gt;, but will likely get short shrift -- namely, that Congress will be &lt;em&gt;continuing their fifth week of vacation&lt;/em&gt; rather than returning to Washington to vote on whether America should go to war or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we'll have an entire week or more to discuss the morality and &lt;em&gt;realpolitik&lt;/em&gt; of striking Syria, because no vote will happen before -- at the &lt;em&gt;earliest&lt;/em&gt; -- next Monday.  Because, once again, Congress needs a &lt;em&gt;fifth&lt;/em&gt; week of vacation before they drag their mostly-useless carcasses back to Washington to attempt to do the nation's business.  Even when that business is deciding the question of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Congress were capable of acting quickly in an emergency [pause for riotous laughter], they would have all flown back to D.C. in the middle of last week, held a hasty vote on whether to strike Syria or not, and then they would have been able to fly back out of town to &lt;em&gt;still enjoy their fifth week of vacation this week&lt;/em&gt;.  Don't believe it?  The British managed to do exactly that (Parliament was likewise on vacation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might point out that things didn't turn out so well in Britain, despite their speed.  Parliament, after all, voted down the Prime Minister's request for war authorization -- the first time they've done so in something like &lt;em&gt;two centuries&lt;/em&gt;.  So maybe having to cut their vacations short annoyed members of David Cameron's party so much that they handed him a political loss in retaliation.  I can easily see -- &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; -- members of the United States Congress acting in such a petulant fashion, so perhaps Obama was right not to call them back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, it's going to be hard for the media to ignore the intervening week between Obama announcing he wants a vote in Congress and Congress actually being in town to hold such a vote.  Perhaps the media will also notice that, for the months of August and September, Congress has scheduled exactly nine days in session.  That's not even two full work weeks, out of two whole months of time.  And that, my friends, is nothing short of pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what is on their plate, in this time period, in &lt;em&gt;addition&lt;/em&gt; to deciding the monumental question of war: the entire federal budget.  The Senate has passed a budget, the House has passed a budget, and yet no compromise is even currently being worked on to reconcile the two into the individual appropriations bills which must be passed by the first of October, or the federal government shuts down.  House Republicans couldn't even agree &lt;em&gt;among themselves&lt;/em&gt; over a farm bill, before they all fled the city for their five-week vacation.  Congress will be forced to fall back on the gigantic lie of "there just isn't time" and pass some sort of omnibus continuing resolution, and punt the ball down the road for a few months.  There may be an enormous fight over Obamacare during this process.  Immediately following will come the deadline of the debt ceiling, in mid-October.  Cue up more dysfunction and "round two" of the Obamacare funding fight.  This will all guarantee &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; round of fiscal bickering, probably to coincide with the end of the calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also to be pushed aside during September will be the huge battle over immigration reform.  There just "won't be time" to have this important debate in the House, I confidently predict.  This really isn't going out on a limb, because House Republicans have been trying the Big Stall on immigration all year long.  "We won't pass the Senate bill, even though it probably has enough votes in the House to pass," say the Republicans, "because we're going to come up with our &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; bills instead."  Which have not, as yet, appeared.  Because, you know, "there just wasn't time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick constitutional review: two of the bedrock duties Congress is charged with are passing an annual federal budget and deciding whether America goes to war or not.  Congress has largely abdicated the war responsibility to the White House since roughly World War II, but this has never stopped them from demanding to be involved in the process.  President Obama surprised them by agreeing, on Syria.  Congress shrugged, and said: "We'll think about it in 10 days or so... now how about another round of Mai Tais, everyone?!?"  The budget deadlines are written in stone, so there's simply no excuse for not scheduling enough time for debating the issues, but Congress will only be in session a pathetic nine days this month, after taking all of last month off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will never become a big issue inside the Beltway until it becomes a big issue &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the Beltway.  Until "We The People" demand more of our elected officials, it is never going to happen.  A populist backlash can indeed work, as it did in the 1980s and 1990s over the subject of congressional pay raises.  When people get angry, Congress eventually notices.  Or they get voted out in favor of people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for people to get angry, they have to notice how seldom Congress actually shows up to work.  Which is why it's a good subject for Labor Day.  On this &lt;em&gt;single day off&lt;/em&gt; for the American worker, perhaps the media will begin to point out (and continue to do so, over the next week) that Congress can't even be bothered to cut their &lt;em&gt;five-week vacation&lt;/em&gt; short when America is contemplating an act of war.  Congress won't be voting on Syria until (at the earliest) next Monday.  There is absolutely no reason for this delay other than "I'd like one more week of relaxing on a beach and/or fundraising before I have to do my actual job."  After the war vote (no matter which way it goes), we will then be told that "there just isn't time" to finish the federal budget before October begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you know what?  That's nonsense.  There is, indeed, plenty of time.  There has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been enough time.  It's not the time factor, it is &lt;em&gt;how you choose to use the time&lt;/em&gt;.  Which is why I decided to work on Labor Day myself -- to point out what should be painfully and shockingly obvious, even to people inside the Beltway.  Nine days' work for a period of two months is &lt;em&gt;simply not acceptable&lt;/em&gt;.  It wouldn't even be acceptable if we weren't contemplating a war, or even if Congress had already completely wrapped up this year's budget.  There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things Congress should be working on this month, and nine days falls laughably short of the effort required to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember, nothing will ever change unless people get upset about this sorry state of affairs and demand better from their civil servants.  The only way Congress will ever change is through heaping all the shame upon them that they truly deserve.  Whenever congressional leadership pleads: "There just isn't time," they need to hear the forceful response of: "There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; time!  How about &lt;em&gt;earning your pay&lt;/em&gt;, for once?  Nine working days is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enough!  &lt;em&gt;Get to work&lt;/em&gt;, you slackers!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Labor Day, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find
it hitched to everything else in the Universe."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;-- John Muir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We are tied together in the single garment of
destiny, caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. And whatever affects
one directly affects all indirectly."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;-- Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Labor Day, the Sierra Club joins in celebrating working
people everywhere. As Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, recently
said about the growing collaboration between the labor movement and other
grassroots groups: "It takes all of us working together to get it
done."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years after Dr. King's iconic "I Have a
Dream" speech, and nearly five years after we elected the nation's first
African American president, the movements for economic, racial, and
environmental justice have made historic gains, but daunting challenges remain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The
     clean-energy movement has momentum, with solar and wind power growing by
     leaps and bounds and the coal and nuclear industries on the ropes. Studies
     show that renewable energy and energy efficiency investments create far
     more jobs per dollar spent than fossil fuels. Yet well-funded climate
     deniers continue to obfuscate reality and slow progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More
     than 100,000 people gathered last week in Washington, D.C., to recommit
     themselves to action for racial justice, jobs, and freedom on the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington. Yet this year, the Supreme
     Court eviscerated one of the core gains of the Civil Rights Movement, the
     Voting Rights Act of 1965, and white families, on average, still earn
     about $2 for every $1 that black and Latino families make. Meanwhile,
     communities of color are still disproportionately poisoned by corporate polluters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young people across the globe are mobilizing in unprecedented numbers for
     economic and environmental justice. But their generation faces an
     uncertain future. Student debt in the U.S. totals $1 trillion, and
     one-third of 20 to 24 year olds in the U.S. are neither employed nor
     studying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The immigrant rights movement, with the support of the Sierra Club and others,
     succeeded in getting the Senate to pass a bipartisan immigration reform
     bill. Yet a recalcitrant House has caused hope to fade for comprehensive
     immigration reform in the near future, even though deportations are at
     record levels, and millions of undocumented immigrant workers remain in
     the shadows of our society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The labor movement is surging, too, with fast-food strikes and emerging-worker
     organizing sweeping the nation. But there's still a long road back from
     historically low union density, and the gap between the wealthiest and the
     rest of us has grown wider than ever. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seemingly separate problems are linked -- and so are their
solutions. We can overcome those obstacles and build the "Beloved
Community" that Dr. King often spoke of -- but only if we do it together.
We need each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why labor, racial justice, immigrant rights, and
voting rights organizations are joining with the Sierra Club, the
Communications Workers of America, the NAACP, and Greenpeace in building the
Democracy Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democracy Initiative was formed in response to a
political climate where, owing to the Supreme Court's disastrous &lt;em&gt;Citizens
United&lt;/em&gt; decision, wealthy corporate polluters and union-busters like the
Koch brothers wield unprecedented and corrosive influence in the corridors of
power. Our immediate goals include supporting voters' rights, combating voter
ID laws, and curbing aggressive use of the filibuster in the United States
Senate. Our real purpose, though, is to restore fairness to our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may never be able to outspend the union-busting
corporate polluters, we do outnumber them. By acting strategically and
together, we can use our people power to beat their dollar power every time. If
we want to help working families, protect our air and water, and achieve
justice for all Americans, we must first defend our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Labor Day, the Sierra Club celebrates working people --
and the growing unity of the labor and environmental movements in our quest for
genuine democracy and justice for all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>openDemocracy.net, one of Britain's most thoughtful, respected websites, has just posted more of the truth about university-regime collaborations and their implications for U.S. foreign policy.</summary>
    <author>
        <name>Jim Sleeper</name>
        <uri>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-sleeper/</uri>
    </author>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;Although you wouldn't know it from watching developments in Syria or Egypt, one of the biggest difficulties in reporting and commenting on authoritarian regimes these days is that many have terrific "democratic" window dressing, designed by western-educated consultants and apologists, some very slick, some sharp-tongued, who easily gull or cow American innocents abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can't show this decisively in a newspaper column &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/opinion/sunday/liberal-education-in-authoritarian-places.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0" target="_hplink"&gt;like mine&lt;/a&gt; in this week's &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Sunday Review section. It argues, in 1,200 words, that some American universities are selling out liberal education's core values in collaborating with the authoritarian regimes to set up whole campuses on their turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, openDemocracy.net, one of Britain's most thoughtful, respected websites, has just posted more of the &lt;a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/jim-sleeper/globe-trotting-universities-serve-diplomacy-and-markets-not-democracy" target="_hplink"&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt; about these university-regime collaborations and their implications for U.S. foreign policy, in a 4,700-word opus I wrote a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious problem with these collaborations is authoritarian regimes themselves: Decades ago, anyone reading the Soviet constitution might have thought the USSR a democratic paradise, and you'll be amazed to see how, for example, Singapore's seemingly meticulous legal system asphyxiates freedoms of the press and political expression as Americans look the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that points us to the less-obvious but also important problem: Many Americans who visit and make deals with such countries almost ask to be fooled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Malcolm Muggeridge &lt;a href="http://www.jimsleeper.com/articles/signature-pieces/Folly%20on%20Left,%20Political%20Pilgrims,%20Salmagundi,%201983.pdf" target="_hplink"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; about some American idealists visiting the Soviet Union in the 1930s, "Their delight in all they saw and were told... constitute unquestionable wonders of the age. There were earnest advocates of proportional representation who eagerly assented when the necessity for a Dictatorship of the Proletariat was explained to them, earnest clergymen who walked reverently through anti-God museums... earnest pacifists who watched delightedly tanks rattle across Red Square..." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's happening again now, as globe trotting university presidents and trustees who are carrying liberal education's prestige and skill sets to iron-fisted oligarchies decide -- as Lincoln Steffens did of the early Soviet Union -- that they've "seen the Future, and it works" in these apparently orderly, energetic, prospering societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, and today's China aren't as totalitarian as the USSR was, although Kazakhstan is still ruled by the autocrat who ran it in its last years as a Soviet Republic. As such rulers welcome corporate capitalism, they may seed some elements of ordered, liberal democracy in ways they don't intend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they're also seeding something ominous: It's becoming even harder, not easier, for investigative reporters, let alone observers like me, to document chilling abuses that are initiated only with arched eyebrows and significant silences at the top and are committed by seemingly ordinary "citizens" or decorously legalistic functionaries, including judges, while the true  progenitors of what is becoming a pervasive fear and self-censorship remain smiling and "clean."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Fear leaves no fingerprints," as William Dobson puts it in &lt;em&gt;The Dictator's Learning Curve&lt;/em&gt;, which unpacks some of these deft, unspoken connections really well. Surveillance and seduction are as effective at silencing people as are truncheons and prison cells. But credulous American university visitors barely notice because they're being welcomed into carefully manicured holding pens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's devilishly hard to track arrangements under which China, Kazakhstan, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore are "buying" liberal education's prestige by bearing all or most costs of constructing the campuses, paying faculty salaries, and subsidizing students' tuition to lure American university leaders who, thinking like the business corporations on whose boards they also serve, are eager to expand their colleges' "brand names" and shares of burgeoning new markets among Asian middle classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the contract between Yale and Singapore for the brand-new Yale-National University of Singapore College that opened last month remains secret, despite repeated Yale College Faculty demands that it be opened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt="2013-09-02-936122_598499260174764_416523387_n.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-02-936122_598499260174764_416523387_n.jpg" width="600" height="398" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo from Yale-NUS College Facebook page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also secret are many of the funding arrangements. "Yale has had no part in financing Yale-NUS, which is largely funded by the Singaporean government, in addition to private contributions," notes Yale undergraduate Cindi Hwang in&lt;a href="http://fpif.org/exporting-the-ivory-tower/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=exporting-the-ivory-tower" target="_hplink"&gt; "Exporting the Ivory Tower"&lt;/a&gt; on the website Foreign Policy in Focus, but not until Kenneth Jeyaretnam, the brave secretary general of Singapore's oft-harrassed Reform Party, read the official Budget documents for 2013, did anyone tell me that the Development Expenditure for the National University of Singapore had shot up from S$19 million [Singapore dollars] in 2011 to S$54 million in 2012 and estimated to be S$43 million in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That could be the cost of construction of the Yale-NUS campus. So, close to S$100 million in capital expenditure likely was spent on building the new campus," notes Jeyaretnam, who holds double honors in economics from Cambridge University and ran a successful hedge fund for several years. But none of what he has observed has been officially disclosed or discovered by the country's cowed or government-controlled press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor has anyone dug behind my own report &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-sleeper/as-yales-blunder-deepens-_b_1569495.html" target="_hplink"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a year ago that a German university vice-chancellor had told me how he thinks "there's $300 million for Yale in this deal." The post set off &lt;a href="http://singaporedesk.blogspot.com/2012/06/where-theres-smoke.html" target="_hplink"&gt;furious rebukes&lt;/a&gt; from the Singapore press and the Yale public information office, but they never disproved the suggestion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor, in regimes whose official reports never clarify what's done in tangles of money laundering and mutual back-scratching can anyone tell the public whether Singapore was behind one of the top 10 contributors -- "Anonymous, for International Studies" -- to Yale's recent $4 billion capital fund-raising campaign, led by Yale trustee G. Leonard Baker, a long-time investor and advisor in Singapore's sovereign wealth fund and a big moral booster of the Yale-NUS project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One certainly can't show things like this in an op-ed piece, which must draw as deftly as it can on reporting that others (including the author) have done at length elsewhere. That's why, if you want to assess the dangers in American universities' collaborations with authoritarian regimes, I hope you'll read&lt;a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/jim-sleeper/globe-trotting-universities-serve-diplomacy-and-markets-not-democracy" target="_hplink"&gt; the revelatory openDemocracy report &lt;/a&gt;as well as the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/opinion/sunday/liberal-education-in-authoritarian-places.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0" target="_hplink"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; column&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Little kids. They're sticky. They drip a lot. And they mess up our stuff. But we wouldn't trade them for anything in the world. We can't. We're actually not allowed. Most countries have very strict laws against it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, since they're still ours for the next 18 or so years, let's learn from them. Here's what children can teach us about happiness. (And, it's technically more things little children can teach us. If you want even more, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-sher/what-children-can-teach-u_b_1586506.html" target="_hplink"&gt;here's the first list&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. They go with their gut.&lt;/strong&gt; Small children don't spend a lot of time fretting over whether they made the right decision. They'd much prefer to spend time fretting over whether you gave them the right color of cup at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. They live in the moment. &lt;/strong&gt;They don't dwell in the past. They don't worry about the future -- unless they are being told that it's almost bedtime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. They believe. &lt;/strong&gt;Little children believe in the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus and the power of Band-Aids. If nothing else, trying to peel the backing off the adhesive distracts kids from what ails them. When all else fails, put a Band-Aid on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. They make stuff. &lt;/strong&gt;They draw. They sculpt. They glue. They paint. They cut anything they can get their hands on. Seriously, keep your scissors hidden and don't say you weren't warned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. They dance.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know the expression, "Dance like nobody's watching"? They do that. Except for the all the times when they want to make damn sure that someone is watching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. They sing.&lt;/strong&gt; They break into song at the drop of a hat. Anytime. Anywhere. Even in the bathroom. Who are we kidding? &lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; in the bathroom.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. They hum.&lt;/strong&gt; Little children hum to themselves quite a bit. Why do they hum? Because they can't whistle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. They say what they mean.&lt;/strong&gt; They speak their mind. They don't need to get anything off their chests because they've already said everything they needed to in the first place. If adults did that, there would be a lot less drinking at Thanksgiving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. They get excited. &lt;/strong&gt;They get so excited! (But have a hard time understanding the "future," so be careful when you tell your son his birthday is coming up... in a couple months.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. They don't care if it's new. &lt;/strong&gt;A child's favorite movies are the ones she's seen again and again. Her favorite books are the ones she's been read over and over. And if she has a favorite dress, she'll want to wear it every day. But adults? We're obsessed with new. We want to be the first to eat in a new restaurant, see a new movie or wear a designer's new "It" bag. Adults are really annoying like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. They stop and smell the roses.&lt;/strong&gt; They're big on smelling things. Of course, the irony is that so many small children aren't potty trained and don't seem to give a sh*t about their own you-know-what. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. They don't discriminate.&lt;/strong&gt; Until taught otherwise, they're accepting of everyone. Well, everyone except babies. The number one insult from a small child is being called a "baby." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. They admit when they're scared. &lt;/strong&gt;This lets us help them alleviate their fears. Sometimes, the solution is as easy as turning on a night-light. If only all of our fears could be solved by turning on a night-light.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. They accept compliments.&lt;/strong&gt; When you give a child a compliment, she'll probably answer with either "thank you," or "I know."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. They nap&lt;/strong&gt;. They may go into it kicking and screaming, but most little children nap and wake up new-and-improved. We'd all be a little better off if we napped. (And richer, too, since we'd spend a whole lot less money at Starbucks.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. They go to bed early.&lt;/strong&gt; But it's not by choice and it takes a lot of effort on our part because they actually believe the expression "you snooze, you lose." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. They engage.&lt;/strong&gt; Psychologist Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi calls immersing oneself fully into an activity the secret to happiness. He calls it "flow." Children often become so deeply engrossed in what they're doing that they don't hear you when you call them. Tip: If they don't answer to their name, try whispering the words "chocolate chip cookie."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. They march to the beat of their own drum.&lt;/strong&gt; Literally. Little kids can often be found marching around their houses banging on things.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;Just before 7:00 a.m. on August 29, I arrived at the "Rock and Roll" McDonald's in downtown Chicago and saw a growing crowd of people wearing red T-Shirts saying "Strike for 15" and "We are Worth More." They were part of a nationwide one-day strike of poverty wage workers who were calling for $15 an hour and the right to form a union.&amp;nbsp;I was there to express my support because for years I've been fighting to reverse the debilitating and growing income inequality in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workers energetically shouted chants like "I can't survive on eight twenty-five." &amp;nbsp;$8.25 is the minimum wage in Illinois, a full dollar higher than the Federal minimum wage. McDonald's employees work an average of 24 hours per week, and those I spoke with who had been working a decade or more had advanced up to $8.50 per hour, earning a grand total of $10,608 for the whole year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare that to the pay package of McDonald's CEO Donald Thompson -- $13,751,919 in 2012. That comes out to an hourly wage of $6,611. Don earns more in the first two hours of the first day of the year than a McDonald's worker makes all year long. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lest you think Donald Thompson isn't thinking about his workers, check out the "&lt;a href="http://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/mcdonalds/documents/McD_Journal2.pdf" target="_hplink"&gt;Practical Money Skills&lt;/a&gt;" packet and the sample budget he gave his employees. The budget lists income for the worker's first job and second job, all totaling $2,060 for the month, acknowledging off the bat that no one can live on what he pays them. Recommended monthly expenses include $600 for housing and $20 per month for health insurance, amounts that are suitable only in his fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many low wage workers need government assistance just to make ends meet -- food stamps (now called the SNAP program) and health care. And lots of the wealthy Americans, including most of the Republicans in the U.S. House, not only want to cut these programs, but actually demonize the people who use them, suggesting they are lazy or drug addicts. But, in fact, the real Welfare Kings are the Fast Food Giants and all those poverty wage employers who refuse to pay a livable wage. They depend on the taxpayer-funded government programs to subsidize their employees. &amp;nbsp;It's the Wal-Marts and McDonald's that need those welfare programs. They are the Takers, not the Makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not always such in America. Between 1948 and 1973, the productivity of U.S. workers &amp;nbsp;rose 96.8 percent and wages rose 93.7 percent. &amp;nbsp;But between 1973 and 2011, productivity rose 80.1 percent but wages rose only 4.2 percent. &amp;nbsp;Median household income today, adjusted for inflation, is at 1989 levels. It is not coincidental that during that same time, union membership dropped from about 1/3 of the private sector workforce to about 6.5 percent today. &amp;nbsp;Nor is it coincidental that almost all of the growth in income, and yes, we are richer as a country than ever, has gone to the top 2 percent, and especially the top .1 percent. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Service Employees International&amp;nbsp;Union, SEIU, who helped organize these one day strikes, median weekly wages in 2010 for union workers was $917, and $717 for non-union workers. That adds up to a life-style changing $10,400 per year advantage for union workers. No wonder the fast food industry and other low wage employers threaten or actually fire anyone engaged in union organizing. And no wonder more and more workers are fighting for union representation, their ticket to the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the McDonald's rally, two of the workers spoke about their years of service to the company and the impossibility of living on the low wages. They also addressed the poor treatment. &amp;nbsp;Many of us went inside to present a letter from the Workers Organizing Committee of Chicago to the manager. &amp;nbsp;It wasn't much of a surprise that no one was available to accept the letter which read in part, "The hard-working employees at your location ask that you make the following changes immediately: 1) Stop requiring employees to pay out-of-pocket if their cash registers are short 2) Show respect to your employees -- less shouting and insulting language. 3) Air conditioning in the kitchen &amp;nbsp;4) Permit employees to drink water when the kitchen gets too hot. 5) Give raises and provide living wages 6) Stop requiring employees to pay out-of-pocket for food that is returned by customers." The whole event was passionate and peaceful. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. &amp;nbsp;That march sought to "give all Americans a decent standard of living" and called for a minimum wage of $2.00 per hour. &amp;nbsp;Adjusted for inflation, that would equal $15.26 an hour -- just about what the workers were asking for. &amp;nbsp;Congress can take significant action by substantially raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing all workers the right to organize.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>At a time when ambitious business-school professors and salivating entrepreneurs predict the end of the university as we know it, and at a time when we have never been more in need of an educated workforce and citizenry, the task of understanding the evolving mission and performance of American higher education has never been more urgent.</summary>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;American higher education is the envy of the world. Students flock to this country from all over, and the most highly ranked schools tend to be here. We should be proud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American higher education is a mess. With high costs, low graduation rates, unhappy faculty members and coddled students, our universities are about to be radically disrupted by massive, technologically driven change. A good thing, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to reconcile these opposing views? At a time when ambitious business-school professors and salivating entrepreneurs predict the end of the university as we know it, and at a time when we have never been more in need of an educated workforce and citizenry, the task of understanding the evolving mission and performance of American higher education has never been more urgent. Thank goodness Derek Bok, a two-time president of Harvard and a judicious, learned analyst of education, has taken on this undertaking. His book is too long to be called a report card, but it is a detailed progress report on the challenges and opportunities facing our nation's colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things to note about higher ed in the United States is its heterogeneity. The problems of Harvard are not the same as the problems of the University of Texas or those of Scripps College in California or of LaGuardia Community College in New York. Bok tries to address schools in all their multiplicity, and his book suffers somewhat from the clunkiness that also characterizes higher ed. The book's five sections discuss instruction from undergraduate to graduate and professional schools, as well as the market forces at work at each level. After the introduction, there are five forewords and four afterwords -- not including the short final chapter called "The Last Word." Yet one forgives redundancies because of the thoroughness of the research and the measured judgment consistently applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After noting the variety in higher ed, Bok acknowledges the extraordinary inequalities in the sector. Public discussion of education often focuses on the schools most difficult to get into, but "no more than two hundred colleges regularly reject more students than they admit." At most highly selective schools (such as the one at which I am president), students receive some subsidy from the institution -- even those paying full tuition. Students enrolled at less-selective schools get a small fraction of that support. Public institutions have seen dramatic reductions in state support for universities, and many flagship campuses are scrambling for donations and out-of-state, full-tuition-paying students. Community colleges enroll dramatically more people than other parts of the sector, but most of these students will never earn a degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bok shows that the current quip that universities haven't changed their teaching styles since the Middle Ages is just an empty canard. Universities have adapted surprisingly well to massive changes in technology, in demography and in developing streams of support. But Bok is no Pollyana, emphasizing that "universities have been especially slow to act . . . in improving the quality of undergraduate education." Professors often confuse their desire to teach what interests them the most with what undergrads need to learn, and students in recent years are spending far less time on their studies than in past generations. Bok shows how schools cater to students in order to attract more of them, often with little attention to how campus amenities provide distractions from studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bok knows the governance structures of universities as well as anyone, and he realizes that true curricular reform has to be led by the faculty. The challenge, from his perspective, is to make the faculty (at least its leadership) more aware of the empirical work on student learning that has been done over the past decade. Professors may be focused on their research and distracted by committee work, but the evidence shows that they care deeply about teaching effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The key to educational reform," Bok writes, "lies in gathering evidence that will convince faculty that current teaching methods are not accomplishing the results that the professors assume are taking place." Once the teachers understand the need for change, they will rise to the occasion and create classes that are more effective at developing the capacities that most agree are essential in college graduates. They have done so in the past, and they will do so again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bok's confidence in the faculty is characteristic of his approach in this book. He believes that our varied system of higher education is very much capable of self-correction. Do we need to bend the cost curve? Sure, and that is why experiments such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) are so interesting (and mostly led by university veterans). Is there a liberal bias on our campuses? Sure, and it has been there at least since the 1940s, but faculty members realize they need more political diversity. Do university leaders spend too much time raising money? Sure, but American schools -- especially the selective ones -- get much more support than schools in other countries. We may have the worst system, he jokes, but like democracy, it's better than all the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bok underscores two areas in urgent need of improvement: increasing the percentage of students who graduate from college and improving the quality of undergraduate education. We must do a better job attracting low-income students to our best colleges and universities, no longer wasting financial aid on wealthy students with high SAT scores to improve an institution's place in bogus rankings. We must also do a better job of stimulating curricular reform and assessment so as to be sure students are working hard to learn what they need to know -- whether at a community college or a research university. Of course, reaching agreement on what students need to know is a great challenge, but that's the core of the faculty's responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition among schools produces benefits and causes problems. Most of the important ones are addressed in Bok's helpful volume. I hope he is right that we already have the ingredients in place to make the necessary reforms. I know we need university leaders like him to help activate those ingredients so that American higher education can continue to contribute in vital ways to our culture, our economy and our polity.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;America's fortunate workers, those who have Labor Day off, will spend the holiday resting and playing, rejoicing and picnicking. Much of that activity will occur in public parks across this nation, places that are community commons, purchased, developed and protected by collectives of citizens for shared benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of community employees will forego the day off to protect one of those parks, beloved Yosemite, threatened by the California rim fire. These firefighters will risk their lives to preserve the park's giant sequoias from what is now the sixth largest wildfire in the state's history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating parks and fighting fires are manifestation of community. Citizens also come together in community to operate schools and libraries, to build roads and bridges. Citizens unite to sustain police departments, sewage treatment systems, public hospitals and transit.  The American community chose to work jointly to protect the elderly and vulnerable with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Much can be accomplished with concerted effort that's simply impossible for individuals. No single property owner could vanquish the 192,500-acre rim fire.  A union of people is greater than the sum of its members. That's why labor unions succeed in securing decent wages and benefits for workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the nation commemorated the 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and Rev. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech inspired once again. No individual, not even the great Rev. King, could have persuaded Congress to pass civil rights legislation. A great orator alone doesn't move mountains. But a crowd of 250,000 united in purpose, well, that can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anthem of the movement tells the story as well.  &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/28/216482943/the-inspiring-force-of-we-shall-overcome"&gt;Originally, the words to the spiritual were, "I Shall Overcome."&lt;/a&gt; By the time Joan Baez sang it during the March in 1963, activists who understood the power of unity had changed the words to "We Shall Overcome."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.usw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Robert-Reich-final.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.usw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Robert-Reich-final.jpg" alt="http://on.fb.me/19XfyMM Please like In the Public Interest on Facebook" title="Robert Reich final" width="400" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22464" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses use the strength of unity as well. They join together in special interest groups that then have the leverage necessary to get them what they want. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is an example. A bunch of corporations get together and fund this organization that flies lawmakers to fancy retreats where they are wined and dined and given corporate-serving legislation to pass when they return home. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is another example. Companies gather under the Chamber's lobbying umbrella, which corporations have bought with dues. No one company could achieve the legislative victories that the Chamber accomplishes through its amalgamation of corporate members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political parties and interest groups employ unity as well. But Republicans are so committed to the cult of individualism that they don't seem to have sufficient introspection to see that they exploit the power of collective action. While they condemn Medicare and Social Security as "communist," the only reason Republicans can legislate at all is that they act and vote solidly together as a community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republicans' recent tiff with the Heritage Foundation illustrates how they apply the power of the collective. Heritage told conservatives to oppose the Farm Bill because Heritage wanted the food stamp portion split from the farm subsidy part. Republicans did Heritage's bidding, but then Heritage opposed the split bill, claiming it was too costly. Since Heritage threatens GOPers who don't vote its way, its "moving the goalposts" on the farm bill didn't go over well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., resolved to censure Heritage for it. This is what the right-wing  &lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/republican-lawmakers-retaliate-against-heritage-foundation-20130828"&gt;National Journal wrote about his plan:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To do this, Mulvaney needed strength in numbers. A single conservative lawmaker rebuking a like-minded outside group wouldn't mean much, he decided, but a posse of tea-party types criticizing the very organization that has been lauding their defense of liberty -- now that would grab Washington's attention."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key word is posse. Not a lone ranger, but a collection of cowboys could challenge Heritage and win. Which they did, by kicking it out of the weekly Republican Study Committee meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Republicans use the power of community, they object when workers do.  Across the country, Republican governors and legislatures have passed laws, often at the behest of ALEC, to slam communities of workers -- labor unions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've adopted legislation destroying public sector unions and forbidding labor unions and employers from bargaining about union dues. While claiming to be the party of less government regulation, Republicans are imposing new regulations telling businesses and unions exactly what they can and cannot negotiate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, union members are singing, "We shall overcome."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before unionists and civil rights activists appropriated it, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/28/216482943/the-inspiring-force-of-we-shall-overcome"&gt;this was a work song, sung by slaves in the field.&lt;/a&gt; They sang, "I'll be all right someday."  When it was picked up by churches, the line became, "I'll Overcome Someday."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers striking against the American Tobacco Co. in 1945 changed the line again. &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/28/216482943/the-inspiring-force-of-we-shall-overcome"&gt;They sang,&lt;/a&gt; "We will overcome, and we will win our rights someday." There's strength in "we." By the time of the March on Washington, it's believed Bob Dylan popularized the line with "shall" instead of "will."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the March, Rev. King spoke to the need for community, admonishing black citizens to join together with whites. &lt;a href="http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf"&gt;He told the marchers:&lt;/a&gt; "We cannot walk alone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor groups helped organize the March and Rev. King supported collective bargaining. On the day he died, he'd gone to Memphis to march with 1,300 striking sanitation workers. Rev. King knew that union brothers and sisters walk together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected by the vital need to improve the lot of America's middle class, workers in solidarity shall overcome threats to their right to collectively bargain for better wages, safer working conditions and decent benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;Ironically it is America's first ally, France, that has held firm to the precept of holding the Syrian regime accountable for their slaughter of innocents in breach of international law by the indiscriminate use of poison gas, and at that the most gruesomely deadly agent in the lexicon of gas, namely the nerve agent "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raymond-j-learsy/syria-iran-and-the-specte_b_2260943.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Sarin&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The chemical massacre of Damascus cannot be and must not remain unpunished. There are few countries with capacities to inflict sanctions with the appropriate means. France is among those" as M. Hollande, President of France, was quoted in the French daily &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Britain's parliamentary rejection of military intervention this past week, and President  Obama's newly formulated hesitancy to proceed, subjecting the decision to go forward to Congressional approval, what will this mean to France's willingness to stand at the ready? Certainly, in France, President Obama can count on one major Western ally should he move forward. But if a Congressional mandate is not forthcoming, what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impossible to say? Perhaps. But consider that France together with Britain assumed a leadership role in disposing General Gaddafi in Libya and, even more tellingly, almost singlehandedly, by putting boots on the ground, rescued Mali from a brutal takeover by radical Islamists, thereby securing Mali's independence and in consequence practically all of Central Africa that surely would have become in time, vassals to a Radical Islamist Mali State. France has also played a role and continues to play a role in support of the Algerian government and its confrontation with radical elements such as Al-Qaeda of North Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, perhaps there is another profound element weighing on M. Hollande and France. It is the historical connect of the gruesome images of the hundreds of unbloodied, lifeless pathetic gassed bodies of children, women and men strewn and stacked on broad expanses of earthen turf. The profound visual horror brings back to mind the deepest perversion and anguish of European culture, namely the horrors of the likes of Deutschland's Auschwitz of which France too was the victim. Perhaps it is solidarity with the victims of Damascus that has caused Hollande and France to voice their determination, and now to assume a leading role. As if to declare, 'We know, we have been there, it can not be permitted to happen again."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Hours of boredom, cramped seating and stale sandwiches -- layovers are well known to be anything but fun. Also, since airlines now fly bigger planes and have reduced the number of flights, layovers have gotten significantly longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the good news: In response to this woeful trend, a handful of well-managed airports around the world are taking their services and amenities up a serious notch. To see which ones we're talking about, click &lt;a href="http://www.executivetravelmagazine.com/slideshows/best-airports-for-a-long-layover/1" title="Best Airports for a Long Layover" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore's Changi International Airport, for example, has movie theaters, a butterfly garden, a 40-foot slide, a rooftop pool and other fun distractions. Closer to home, San Francisco International Airport receives accolades for well-rounded offerings such as a SFMOMA Museum Store, a distinguished airport museum, a branch of the city's Steinhart Aquarium and seasonally sourced local grub.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;"What's outrageous?  Poverty wages!"  This chant, echoed by thousands of striking fast food workers as they marched in the streets in New York, Chicago, and dozens of other cities on August 29, has begun to arouse the American conscience this Labor Day.  The fast food industry produces billions in profits for corporations like McDonald's and Burger King.  But, according to the organizers of the recent walkouts, fast food workers in New York City make only 25% of what they need to survive from their jobs.  Fast food workers in other cities aren't much better off.  In many ways, their struggle symbolizes the immorality of an economy that is producing jobs that keep workers poor.  Who can argue with picket signs that say, "We can't survive on $7.25"?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that religious leaders have been conspicuously present on many of the fast food workers' picket lines.  The recent protests have seen priests and ministers, rabbi and imams joining hands with fast food workers.  The nation's largest labor-religious coalition, Interfaith Worker Justice, which is sponsoring Labor Day prayer services in cities across the country honoring the dignity of labor, has taken up their cause.   So has Rev. Cheri Kroon, of the Flatbush Reform Church in Brooklyn.  In April Rev. Kroon told the New York Times that her community was "filled with fast-food workers who have been suffering due to low wages, no sick days and unsafe working conditions." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The faith leaders now rallying to support fast food workers' demands for a living wage are reviving one of America's oldest and most powerful arguments for social justice, one deeply rooted in religious ideals.  Many of those marching today for a fifteen-dollar wage for fast food workers might not realize that the very term "living wage" was first popularized by an American Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor John A. Ryan.  In 1906 Fr. Ryan published a book called A Living Wage, which argued that workers deserved to earn enough to support themselves and their families in dignity.  Over the next three decades, Ryan emerged as the nation's most forceful moral advocate for minimum wage.   Many saw the passage of the federal minimum wage law in 1938 as a fulfillment of Ryan's long crusade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was not just Ryan and Catholic co-religionists who helped elevate the ideal of a living wage in the United States.  Two years after Ryan's book, the Methodist Episcopal Church adopted a "Social Creed" that endorsed the idea of "a living wage in every industry," and the nation's most prominent Jewish rabbi, Stephen Wise also took up this call.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only have religious leaders from across the spectrum consistently defended the living wage demand over the last century, activists from many faiths have spent much of the last decade laying the moral groundwork for the fight for justice that is now being waged by fast food workers.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nation's first living wage ordinance passed in Baltimore in 1994.  Soon fights for the living wage spread to many cities.  It did not take long for religious communities to get involved.  A decade ago many faiths began to go on record again in support of living wage demands.  The Disciples of Christ adopted a resolution in 2005.  In 2006, Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi, President of the Fiqh Council of North America, issued a fatwa indicating that living wage demands were consistent with Islamic Shari'ah law.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Rabbi Jill Jacobs authored a teshuvah (legal position) on the obligation to pay a living wage was passed by the Conservative Movement's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, and that same year the Presbyterian Church's "Social Creed for the 21st Century" endorsed the living wage demand.  Many other denominations followed suit.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the living wage ideal has been broadly embraced by the nation's religions, and the Catholic Church, which helped introduce living wage demand in the early 20th century, seems poised to provide leadership on the issue again.  "Not paying a just wage, not providing work, focusing exclusively on the balance books, on financial statements, only looking at making personal profit. That goes against God!" says Pope Francis, the world's most visible religious leader.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As workers take to the streets to fight for a living wage in fast food and other low paying industries, they can take comfort from knowing the nation's religions are increasingly aligned with their cause.  That is one reason for hope this Labor Day that we might finally reverse the trend toward inequality that has so long afflicted us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joseph A. McCartin directs the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University and serves on the board of Interfaith Worker Justice.  He is the author of Collision Course: Ronald Reagan, the Air Traffic Controllers, and the Strike that Changed America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>A happy Labor Day to all -- a day for a last summer outing to the beach, a three-day weekend to shop the sales, or maybe just a day to stay home and get ready for the school year. And, oh yeah, a day to honor working people. As Labor Day weekend approached, fast food workers in at least 50 cities went on one-day strikes to demand a living wage. One double-edged analogy that comes to mind is the Occupy movement. It created a venue to confront the chasms of inequality in American society and the power of Wall Street. But what Occupy did not do was to translate into a durable politics that led to real reform. That's what the fast food movement needs to do.</summary>

        &lt;p&gt;A happy Labor Day to all -- a day for a last summer outing to the beach, a three-day weekend to shop the sales, or maybe just a day to stay home and get ready for the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, oh yeah, a day to honor working people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this Labor Day approached, fast food workers in at least 50 cities went on one-day strikes to demand a living wage. The movement, organized by community groups with the strong support of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is a hopeful effort to shine a spotlight on the proliferation of low-wage work -- and specifically to break through the fragmentation of fast food workers in small units where it is almost impossible to organize conventional unions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers without union protections who go out on strike are risking their jobs. But so far, the fast food industry had not wanted to invite public indignation by firing striking workers. This suggests some latent power that remains to be fully mobilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that admirers of this nascent movement are asking is: what comes next? How do these one-day strikes add up to higher wages in fast food, and a national campaign for a true living wage for all American workers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the $7.25 federal minimum wage had simply been adjusted with inflation, it would be around $10 an hour. If it had risen with average U.S. productivity growth, the minimum wage would be over $18 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of mythology suggesting that the proliferation of low-wage payroll jobs, part time work, temp jobs, and precarious independent contractor work has something to do with education levels, or technology. Mostly, it doesn't. The blue-collar middle class of the postwar boom hadn't been to college and many didn't even have high-school diplomas. But they earned what used to be called a family wage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? A different distribution of power between corporations and workers, stronger unions, and pro-worker regulation. Today's service workers, like yesterday's production workers, could also earn a living wage. But before they get a better distribution of income they need a different distribution of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One double-edged analogy that comes to mind is the Occupy movement. It created a venue to confront the chasms of inequality in American society and the power of Wall Street. Occupy also created a nice slogan that captured both things -- The One Percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Occupy did not do was to translate into a durable politics that led to real reform. That's what the fast food movement needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant industry would have you believe that most fast food workers are teenagers working part time for pocket money. That's not accurate. Most are in fact breadwinners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking about how these moments could grow into movements, one important fact is that these restaurants are franchises. McDonald's or Burger King doesn't own the local restaurant, but dictates everything from the menu to the specifications for the napkins. If the parent corporation wanted to, it could also require the local franchise to pay a living wage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the larger campaign needs to be against these national, hugely profitable brands, to make them take responsibility for the working conditions in the franchises that carry their logo and market their food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of encouraging precedents. The SEIU's Justice for Janitors campaign, which now has master contracts with major landlords in several cities, grasped early on that the cleaning contractors that nominally employed janitors had no real power. Their costs were almost entirely labor costs; squeeze them too hard, and another cleaning contractor would get the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real power reposed with the building owner, for whom decent janitorial wages were a very minor share of total costs. So SEIU successfully went after the landlords. It was also crucial to win citywide contracts, so that competition among cleaning contractors based on cheap labor would cease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In several cities, the hotel and restaurant union has similar master agreements with the big brands like Hilton or Marriott. It doesn't matter who happens to own the franchise; the decent labor contract follows the national brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many fast food brands are actually owned by shadowy private equity companies. Stephen Lerner, the organizer who was the architect of the Justice for Janitors campaign, says, "One part of a strategy might be to focus on one or two of the fast food companies, and put massive pressure on them to add to the franchise agreement standards on how workers are paid and treated."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These one-day strikes are not going to lead directly to collective bargaining agreements, one restaurant at a time. But they could do something even more important. They could catalyze public sentiment in favor of a higher minimum wage generally, and bring pressure to bear against the national brands that control the conditions of the franchises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new structure of American industry is requiring a new kind of labor movement. The one-day strikes in fast food are a beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor Day, incidentally, was originally a creation of the trade union movement, beginning in New York in 1882. Following a bitter strike against the Pullman Company that eventually involved 250,000 workers, President Grover Cleveland signed legislation making Labor Day a national holiday beginning in 1894, as a gesture to the growing union movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, enjoy your day off, and please remember that it didn't just happen randomly.&lt;/p&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;I had a series a while back about the &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christianpiatt/2012/07/ten-cliches-christians-should-never-use/" target="_hplink"&gt;Christian Cliches that we should drop from our lexicon&lt;/a&gt;, and since then I've had people ask what they should be saying instead. So here's a list of handy phrases to help bring followers of Jesus into a post-Christendom, 21st-century world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I'm Sorry."&lt;/strong&gt; - There's plenty of hurt in the world related to Christianity, and even though we may not personally be responsible for that damage, it's amazing how far an apology will go. Even if we're only acknowledging the hurt and disenfranchisement, we should show some regret that something of which we are a part has contributed to someone's suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"How can I help?"&lt;/strong&gt; - Sometimes we have a bad habit of diagnosing problems and coming up with the solution without actually sitting down and talking with the folks we're supposedly helping. Though well intended, this can come off as arrogant, and can also end up being a waste of time and resources. Yes, it's more vulnerable to ask an open-ended question like "How can I help?' since the answer might require much more of us than we planned on. But that's the risk of doing real servant work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I don't know."&lt;/strong&gt; - I've listed this one before, but it bears repeating. Some of us have been raised with the misapprehension that we always have to have an answer to every question having to do with our faith. But better than pat, rehearsed (or worse, pulled-out-of-our-asses-on-the-fly) answers is the humility of admitting we have no idea sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I could be wrong."&lt;/strong&gt; - This goes along with #3, as one of the most damaging things in any faith tradition - or in any cultural system, for that matter - is the idolatry of certainty. When we hold so fast to an idea that the people involved take second chair to our certainty, we've created a space where  pain and alienation are sown, rather than compassion and reconciliation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"What do you think?"&lt;/strong&gt; - A third in this theme of what Tony Jones calls "epistemic humility," when it comes to scripture at least, though asking people their thoughts on the Christian faith, the Bible or anything else is a healthy practice for all involved. In fact, I learn more about my faith sometimes from non-Christians than I do from those who are so close to it (like me) that they become blind to the problems, right in front of us. Any good Christian should keep some non-Christian friends on retainer to help keep them in check and lend them some necessary perspective from time to time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I love you."&lt;/strong&gt; - We have the best of intentions when telling others about God or Jesus, but unless this is already a central theme in your life, talking about how God loves you can come off as strangely abstract and a little bit crazy. Rather than speaking for God, it's best if we take the risk and simply speak for ourselves. It sounds nice to say "God loves you," but it's a real and important risk to say "I love you."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Tell me more..."&lt;/strong&gt; - Showing genuine interest in the lives and stories of others is the foundation of Christ-like family. So often we sit right next to people - be it at church, work, school or elsewhere - whose stories we know little or nothing about. Whereas in the past, Christendom's aim was mainly assimilation, a post-Christendom world requires us to be willing to be changed as much as we seek to affect change in our relationships with one another. It's no longer about eradicating differences, but rather, it's about cultivating a love that is stronger than those differences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"That just sucks."&lt;/strong&gt; - This goes along with the Christian compulsion to try and fix everything. But if I've learned anything from thirteen years of marriage, it's that solutions don't always go as far as empathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Let's give it a try."&lt;/strong&gt; - Along with presiding over decades of prolific growth (both numerically and institutionally) many Christians began to believe that they were primarily stewards and guardians of the institution rather than preparers of the way for a divinely-inspired kingdom on earth. It's in the nature of institutions to resist change, however, whereas preparation is all about making room and clearing space in anticipation of something new. As Paul says, our faith requires a childlike "What's next?" kind of openness, rather than leaning so heavily on the spirit-killing mantra of "But we've always done it this way."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say nothing at all &lt;/strong&gt;- Filling awkward silences with chatter is endemic in our entire western culture, but Christians are particularly guilty of whipping out the cliches when there's dead air. Sometimes the best prescription is simply to be present, or maybe to listen. Just because we're Christians doesn't mean we have been commissioned with fixing everything. We could start by adding intentional silence more often into our own spiritual practices, just to get used to how it feels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <summary>While President Obama seems poised to attack Syria, it's not clear what he intends to achieve, apart from saving face.</summary>
    <author>
        <name>Rajan Menon</name>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;For more than two years President Barack Obama has resisted the clamor of the interventionists, avoiding military moves against Bashar al-Assad's regime for fear of being sucked into the vortex of Syria's horrific and complex civil war.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we won't know until the Congressional vote the president has sought is held, this may be about to change following an August 21 chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb that according to Secretary of State John Kerry killed &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23906913" target="_hplink"&gt;1,429 people&lt;/a&gt;, more than 400 of them children.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Obama insists that evidence gathered by America's intelligence agencies proves that the Syrian government was the perpetrator.  Almost exactly a year before this event, he drew a &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/20/world/meast/syria-unrest" target="_hplink"&gt;"red line,"&lt;/a&gt; declaring that his "calculus" would change were Assad to use chemical munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first such allegation against Assad, and President Obama will now be forced to cross the Rubicon unless Congress withholds authorization.  His own red lines, drawn unwisely, have boxed him in, and if he does nothing beyond expressing outrage he will lose credibility.  Or so goes the ubiquitous argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet credibility is itself not a sound or sufficient reason for attacking Syria.  In international politics, acquiring and maintaining a reputation for resolve is not an end per se but a means that states use to achieve intended outcomes.  But what is the outcome Obama seeks in this particular instance?  Don't look to the White House for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president has said that the attack would not seek the destruction of Assad's government but would instead be conducted in a &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/july-dec13/obama_08-28.html?print" target="_hplink"&gt;"a very limited way" to send a "shot across the bow." &lt;/a&gt; This means that the Syrian strongman may take a big hit but still retain enough firepower and troops to continue his killing spree.  He will lose many expensive aircraft and helicopters, but these are not the armaments that account for most of Syria's death toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Obama's goal is to destroy Assad's chemical weapons stockpile or to prevent it from being plundered by terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda, which are now ensconced in chaotic, blood-drenched Syria.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that theory is implausible.  In addition to risking the dispersion of deadly toxins, striking Assad's chemical weapons sites could leave them less well defended for at least two reasons.  First, if the attack diminishes the regime's capacity to safeguard these munitions terrorists could pilfer them more easily.  Second, anticipating an attack, Assad might order that they be moved, and that could enable a chemjacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's conceivable that although the administration's aim is not to topple Assad, it believes that he will not survive for long after absorbing a massive blow directed at his major armaments, airfields, and command and control centers, and even some of his best military units, such as those within the Republican Guard and the Fourth Armored Division.  Even if that's not the outcome foreseen by the White House, it could happen anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that end of the regime will not produce an end to the war.  The House of Assad's surviving cliques and organizational detritus will provide the raw material for forming paramilitary forces -- which already exist, as witness the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14482968" target="_hplink"&gt;shabiha&lt;/a&gt;--that will continue the battle against the various armed anti-Assad Sunni groups.  Given the regime's massive bloodletting, its members, and even their families and associates, cannot expect mercy from their enemies, and so they have compelling reasons to fight to the finish with no holds barred. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of their survival strategy will involve fortifying further the Alawite (the Shiite-offshoot minority sect of Assad and his inner circle) fortress that has already emerged between Syria's coast and the Jabal an-Nusayriyah range. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their part, the Sunni fighters, their morale boosted by Assad's fall, will hunt down pro-regime elements and overrun government-controlled territories with even greater resolve.  And they won't be compassionate during what they will consider the end game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearing that a Sunni victory could dash their dream of independence, or a state within a state, Syria's Kurds will redouble their efforts (which have been backed by their kin in Iraqi Kurdistan) to turn their northeastern domain into a secure homeland. That will increase the tempo of the &lt;a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-20/news/sns-rt-us-syria-crisis-iraq-20130819_1_syrian-kurds-northern-syria-iraqi-kurdistan" target="_hplink"&gt;fighting&lt;/a&gt; that has already been underway between them and radical Sunni groups determined to keep Syria whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while President Obama seems poised to attack Syria, it's not clear what he intends to achieve, apart from saving face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horror of 1,400-plus people being killed by chemical weapons may have moved him, but he has watched as almost 100 times as many Syrians have perished.  The strike he envisages will not end Syria's bloodbath; that will require bigger steps, ones that neither President Obama nor the American public is prepared to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, perhaps at least no more Syrians will die from chemical attacks once Assad is hit and learns a lesson. That's possible, but the civil wars of that have erupted just in the last two decades -- think of Rwanda, the Congo, Darfur and the southern Sudan, and the former Yugoslavia --                     reveal an awful truth. Once their societies dissolve, as Syria's has, into groups that lionize themselves and dehumanize their enemies, people excel at devising ways to kill one another.  The moral restraints of normal times quickly fall away and violence against those who have become "the other" is valorized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atrocities that inevitably follow evoke moral outrage from outsiders. The advocates of "humanitarian intervention" assure us that we now inhabit a more enlightened (post-Cold War) world that has effective, universal norms against mass killing.  The reality is that even the most powerful among the governments that trumpet these norms have been willing to countenance a great deal of killing; so have their citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries capable of military intervention may act -- albeit from safe distances to ensure zero-casualty campaigns a la Bosnia, Kosovo, and Libya -- when they expect that the cost they will incur in blood and treasure will be low or believe that important national security interests are at issue, but not otherwise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever Obama does in Syria will not break this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
