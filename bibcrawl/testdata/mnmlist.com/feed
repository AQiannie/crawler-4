				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a post recently where a blogger and commenters were talking about how minimalism sucks, because owning nothing and traveling the world with nothing but a small suitcase means you&#8217;d never have savings or a safe home for your kids.</p>

<p>Well. There are a couple issues here to discuss.</p>

<p>First, the kind of minimalism they&#8217;re referring to is only one way to do it. Sure, lots of minimalists are bachelors who can easily work anywhere and travel the world with a backpack, or perhaps families who travel and work and live all over the place with almost no possessions. But that&#8217;s just one way.</p>

<p>Another way is to live in a home that&#8217;s big enough (but not overly huge) for your family&#8217;s needs, and to only have what you need and not too much more, and to not focus so much on consumption but more on doing the things you love with the people you love.</p>

<p>And yes, you can travel the world from time to time, with just a small backpack each. But that&#8217;s just one part of your life. At least, that&#8217;s how we do it.</p>

<p>So minimalism isn&#8217;t just one way of life. It&#8217;s figuring out what works best for you (and your family if you have one) but being more mindful of what you own and do. Not obsessing over possessions, but being mindful. It&#8217;s about finding contentment.</p>

<p>Second, you can have a savings as a minimalist. In fact, many minimalists do. It&#8217;s often <strong>easier</strong> to have savings, because if you&#8217;re spending less on needless possessions and a huge home and a couple of huge vehicles, you can put more money in the bank or for retirement. You can do this as a single person, but also as a family. I would recommend it &#8212; having savings gives you peace of mind.</p>

<p>Just wanted to clear up those misconceptions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I wrote my last post, <a href="http://mnmlist.com/havent/">things I don&#8217;t have that many do</a>, someone asked, &#8220;What do you have that most people don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a good question. I cut out a lot of what I found to be unnecessary (for me) to make room for what I find to be more important.</p>

<p>So what do I have instead? Honestly, what I have isn&#8217;t that uncommon, but here goes:</p>


<ul>
<li>leisure time</li>
<li>space in my home</li>
<li>time to read, meditate, exercise</li>
<li>time to write every day</li>
<li>time for my beautiful family</li>
<li>time for close friends</li>
<li>time to walk places (instead of drive)</li>
<li>freedom from car maintenance, car breakdowns, traffic</li>
<li>time to cook simple, healthy meals</li>
<li>the luxury of not worrying what time it is most of the time</li>
<li>disconnectedness when I&#8217;m away from home</li>
<li>fewer distractions even when I&#8217;m connected</li>
<li>my health</li>
<li>less worry</li>
<li>a very light packing list</li>
<li>worry-free finances</li>
<li>a business I&#8217;m proud of</li>
<li>wonderful readers</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sharing this list to brag or imply that I&#8217;m superior in any way to people who have these things. However, I think such a list might serve as inspiration, to show that it&#8217;s possible to give up things we consider normal or necessary.</p>

<p>Things I don&#8217;t have that many do:</p>


<ul>
<li>toaster</li>
<li>microwave</li>
<li>paper towels</li>
<li>car</li>
<li>car loan</li>
<li>car insurance</li>
<li>house loan</li>
<li>home insurance</li>
<li>health insurance</li>
<li>debt</li>
<li>cable TV subscription</li>
<li>TV set</li>
<li>hair</li>
<li>brush or comb</li>
<li>hair products</li>
<li>very many clothes or shoes</li>
<li>paper files</li>
<li>photo albums</li>
<li>gym membership</li>
<li>meat, cheese or eggs in my diet</li>
<li>junk food in my house</li>
<li>magazines or newspapers (nor do I read/watch news online)</li>
<li>a Facebook account</li>
<li>Instagram or Pinterest</li>
<li>ads or popups on my websites</li>
<li>affiliate program for my products</li>
<li>social sharing buttons</li>
<li>a suitcase</li>
<li>a watch</li>
<li>smart phone</li>
</ul>



<p>Again, I&#8217;m not better than anyone who has these things. I&#8217;ve just found them to be unnecessary in my life, and I&#8217;ve removed them to make room for things I love more.</p>

<p>p.s. Yes, hair was included to make you smile, but also yes, not having hair is an intentional choice. I shave my head weekly. It saves me a ton of time in hair maintenance, and I never have to worry if I look good while I&#8217;m out &amp; about. I always look good, in other words.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest reasons people buy so much, and are so discontent with their lives, is <a href="http://mnmlist.com/ad-free/">advertising</a>. Advertising creates <a href="http://mnmlist.com/fake-needs/">false needs</a> &#8212; all of a sudden we need an iPhone or a new car or <a href="http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/45768546804/diamonds-are-bullshit">a diamond ring</a>, just because an advertiser put the need in our heads.</p>

<p>What is advertising? It&#8217;s a company (or political candidate, etc.) paying a publishing platform (TV, newspaper, website, billboard, etc.) to get its message/brand in front of people. Companies are paying for our attention, and trying to get us to buy what they&#8217;re selling. And the publisher makes money by selling the attention of its readers/watchers/users.</p>

<p>Of course, for us, the users &#8230; it sucks. Ads make the watching experience much worse. Ads make the reading experience much worse (imagine reading this article with 10 ads surrounding it).</p>

<p>Ads make our lives worse.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that amazing? Companies build entire businesses around <strong>actively making our lives worse</strong>. And they do it because it works. Because we buy what they&#8217;re selling, so advertisers make more money through this model, and publishers also win.</p>

<p>But we lose.</p>

<p>Many people, of course, would rather not have ads if given the choice. I prefer to watch a TV show on iTunes (where I might pay a dollar or two for the show) rather than pay for cable TV where I might get many more shows for the same dollar or two, but also have to put up with advertising. Honestly, I don&#8217;t need that many shows, and I&#8217;m not willing to pay less in order to make my life worse.</p>

<p>Lots of people will put up with ads to get content for free. But it&#8217;s not free, because:</p>

<p>1. Your life is worse for having to watch the ads.<br />
2. You are paying for the ads, and thus the content, by buying more. If you weren&#8217;t, advertising wouldn&#8217;t exist.<br />
3. The time you spend watching ads is worth something.</p>

<p>This is becoming more important than ever because of the amount of time our lives are spent online and in front of screens, and thus potentially in front of ads. There are two directions I see advertising going in the future:</p>

<p>1. <strong>All pervasiveness</strong>. This is the direction it seems to be going. We spend so much time on things like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, and other websites, and they&#8217;re all covered in invasive advertising. And with iPhones and Google Glass, that&#8217;s expanding to fill almost every moment of our waking lives. Advertising will be everywhere, tailored specifically to you now that advertisers and publishers have so much data about who you are.</p>

<p>However, I submit that there will be more and more services in the coming years that help us to block out ads. Obviously in the browser there are ad-blocking plugins/extensions, and people use things like Tivo to skip ads on television. We can pay to have no ads on some services. This is a worthwhile service, to pay to make your life less crappy, though of course not everyone will be able to afford this kind of service. So some will pay to have zero ads, and others will not afford it and have ads everywhere, all the time. The difference between these two kinds of lives will be huge.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Choose no ads</strong>. Some smart publishers will choose to have no ads. I have no ads here on mnmlist, nor on <a href="http://zenhabits.net">Zen Habits</a>. How do I support myself, if not with ads? By selling my own services. This obviously is like advertising, but I think it&#8217;s better. I don&#8217;t have ads ruining your experience, and the only thing I sell is what I already have for free on my site (help for improving your life). And because you already know me and come to my site for this, you&#8217;re more likely to trust me than some random advertiser. If I violate that trust, you will stop going to my site. I have a strong incentive to keep your trust by being trustworthy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just one publisher on the Internet, but there are others. We are the exceptions, but I think we&#8217;re important exceptions. Readers/users/viewers can choose publishers who don&#8217;t have advertising, and avoid/block those who do. Opt out. Be conscious about who you go to, who you trust. If enough people do this, <strong>having no ads will become a competitive advantage</strong>. That will then encourage others to do the same, and then we will be able to choose a life without crappy ads, without having to pay extra.</p>

<p>Which future happens is up to you. You can opt to not read/watch/use sites and services with ads (and if you&#8217;re a publisher, you can create an ad-free business model), or you can put up with crappy ads and let the all-pervasiveness win.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A website with the main purpose of having people read content would best serve its readers with almost nothing else but what&#8217;s needed for the reading experience.</p>

<p>Strip a site of all its distraction, cruft, gimmicks, promotions, advertising, social sharing and more &#8230; and all you have is the pure reading experience.</p>

<p>A minimalist website. Perfect for the readers, which is perfect for the writer. Not so perfect for advertisers and marketers, perhaps, but we&#8217;re not creating sites for them. We&#8217;re creating sites for us.</p>

What&#8217;s necessary for a pure, perfect reading experience?<br />
<ol>
	<li>The text of an article, including headline</li>
	<li>A good-sized, readable font</li>
	<li>A column width optimal for reading</li>
	<li>Perhaps the name of the site for context, and minimal navigation in case the reader wants to find other articles</li>
</ol>
<div>Nothing else.

<p>Here&#8217;s what a minimalist website should leave out:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ads</li>
	<li>cookies</li>
	<li>tracking</li>
	<li>popups</li>
	<li>sharing buttons</li>
	<li>comments</li>
	<li>multiple pages/slides per article</li>
	<li>Facebook or other social widgets</li>
	<li>a widget showing recent comments or tweets</li>
	<li>tags or related posts</li>
	<li>syndicated content widgets taking them to other sites so you&#8217;ll get money</li>
	<li>something screaming for the reader to sign up for your newsletter</li>
</ul>

In addition, a minimal site might also feature:<br />
<ul>
	<li>minimal images (none, or only the most necessary)</li>
	<li>the logo of the site in <span class="caps">CSS</span>-styled text, not an image</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters">small page weight</a></li>
	<li>short urls (without .php, .asp, .aspx, .html, dates, categories or other items in the url) &#8212; see the url of the posts on this site as an example</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there examples of this on the web? Sure, there are plenty. My sites, <a href="http://mnmlist.com">mnmlist.com</a>, <a href="http://zenhabits.net">Zen Habits</a>, and <a href="http://leobabauta.com">leobabauta.com</a> are three examples, but there are many others that come close. Recent networks <a href="http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters/">svtle</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/frontpage-picks/348a9f60e176">medium</a> and <a href="http://feathe.rs/201212061530">feathe.rs</a> come to mind. And there&#8217;s also <a href="http://natewienert.com/codename-obtvse">obtvse</a>. I admire <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html">Paul Graham</a>, and <a href="http://sstephenson.us/posts/on-configuration">Sam Stephenson</a> has only published a couple of articles, but they look great.</p>

<h2>Why minimal?</h2>
Bloggers and website creators get so caught up in things that they lose sight of what&#8217;s the most important thing: creating a great experience for the reader. The person coming to your site isn&#8217;t a customer, a potential mailing list subscriber, a consumer of advertising, a person who wants to be marketed to, a buyer of your affiliate products, a Facebook or Twitter follower &#8230; he&#8217;s a person who simply wants some information or entertainment from what you&#8217;ve written.

<p>The person (I affectionately call her &#8220;my dear reader&#8221; but really she&#8217;s a person) just wants to read what you have to offer, and perhaps at that point might want to read more or even subscribe. All the other things you might put on your site are not for the reader.</p>

<p>When you create an amazing reading experience for the reader, he or she will appreciate it. The reader will love your great content (I hope), and then decide whether to bookmark it, email it, share it, subscribe, whatever. But without the reading experience, all the rest isn&#8217;t happening.</p>

All the other stuff is distracting. It detracts from the experience. Sure, maybe it&#8217;ll help you reach your goals as a writer/site creator, but it doesn&#8217;t help the reader reach her goals. So if you put the distractions in to meet your goals, what message are you sending? That your goals are more important than those of the person who has graciously consented to come to your site and give you the gift of her attention.<br />
<h2>But what about &#8230;</h2>
<strong>Comments</strong>: The comments in most cases detract from the reading experience. They&#8217;re not necessary for reading. Good discussion of the post can be continued elsewhere, such as on Twitter or Facebook or other people&#8217;s blogs, if they find the post worth talking about. For a few years, I had comments on my site, and they weren&#8217;t the worst thing, but I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that they&#8217;re unnecessary.

<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Don&#8217;t popups and big subscription boxes and other such things that ask the reader to subscribe to your mailing list get much better conversion numbers? Sure, in the short term, your numbers will go up. But those are unimportant numbers. Much more important: How much did you delight the reader? How many readers did you lose because you disrespected them with a popup or screaming in the sidebar asking them to subscribe? How much trust did you lose? Who did you help with this popup? Try measuring those numbers with your analytics.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing</strong>: Don&#8217;t you need sharing buttons to succeed in social media and get a million followers? No, and anyway, that&#8217;s not very important. I&#8217;ve succeeded in large part without sharing buttons (I had them for awhile but removed them) because what I focus on is what I think the reader wants most &#8212; the article. If they want to share, they know how to do that. And for those who just care about the article, and not sharing, having a million sharing buttons in their face just ruins the reading experience.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics</strong>: How do I know if I&#8217;m growing without analytics? You don&#8217;t really, and honestly, it doesn&#8217;t matter as much as people think. I used to track my blog&#8217;s statistics, and when you track something like that, it becomes your world. You care so much about growing it that you do things aimed directly at growing the numbers. And that&#8217;s crazy &#8212; the numbers don&#8217;t matter that much. What matters is helping your readers, delighting them, changing their lives. You don&#8217;t do those things by worrying about the numbers &#8212; you do them by worry about the readers. And when you do that, the growth comes as a byproduct of being great.</p>

<p><strong>Making money</strong>: I am a strong believer in making a living doing what you love, but does it really feel good to force your readers to look at crappy ads or see a &#8220;Sponsored By&#8221; post in their inbox, so you can make a few bucks? I used to do it, and it grated on me, because I personally detest advertising. It&#8217;s a daily annoyance that we put up with in order to get what we want (watch the news, be entertained, ride the bus, read good articles) but why put your readers through this annoyance? You can make money as a writer or website creator without ads, without being a slimy marketer. Just build an audience by being useful and trustworthy, then help them with books, courses, software, a service, or whatever you can create that helps them even more deeply. Making money by helping people? Now that feels good.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all spend much of our lives in fantasies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m included in that observation: I fantasize about living a simple, minimalist life, I fantasize about traveling to foreign wonders, I fantasize about having a nice body, about being a great writer, about being the perfect father, and on and on.</p>

<p>This is how we spend so much of our lives. Goals are fantasies. Sometimes fantasies come true &#8212; but even then, the reality that comes true is not exactly what we fantasized about. It&#8217;s a disappointment.</p>

<p>If you saw the announcement of the iPhone5 recently, you might be fantasizing about owning it (or any other gadget for that matter). You fantasize that it will make your life better, that you&#8217;ll feel cooler. Your image of yourself, as you use this incredibly cool gadget, is nicer. It&#8217;s part of a beautiful, simple, productive, enjoyable life that you fantasize about &#8212; the iPhone5 will help you get there!</p>

<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t true. The iPhone5 might be faster, with a better camera, lighter, a more beautiful design &#8230; but none of these things will really make your life that much better. Will it save you a few seconds a day in doing the tasks you normally do? Sure. Will your photos be nicer? Yeah. But putting aside the fantasy, how much will your life really be different?</p>

<p>Think of life before the iPhone existed. We used to be able to work without them. We walked around without checking email or Twitter or our stocks, but &#8230; we somehow survived. It was possible to wait a few minutes or an hour until we got home or to work. We maybe couldn&#8217;t look restaurants up as easily, but we still found food, miraculously.</p>

<p>Life might have been different, but having this device didn&#8217;t change the basic fundamental nature of our lives. The fantasy hasn&#8217;t come true.</p>

<p>It might sound like I&#8217;m picking on the iPhone, but I don&#8217;t mean to. It&#8217;s just emblematic of an overall phenomena in our minds &#8212; the fantasies we have, and how reality never measures up. We&#8217;re disappointed in reality then, even if it&#8217;s actually more incredible than the fantasies themselves.</p>

<p>Minimalism is a fantasy as well. People buy into it because it&#8217;s a lovely idea, living with little, being content, having a spartan workspace and living room. I buy into it, absolutely. But minimalism doesn&#8217;t have to be a fantasy: I also use it as a tool for mindfulness, for living more consciously, for remembering what&#8217;s important.</p>

<p>Minimalism can be a tool for remembering that when we buy gadgets, or almost anything really, we are buying into a fantasy. And then we can remember that we don&#8217;t need the fantasy to be happy. We have something right in front of us: reality.</p>

<p>Reality, without fantasies, is perfect. It&#8217;s a gift. Let&#8217;s learn to love it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, nearly everything we want to know is a few keystrokes away, almost instantly gratifying our desire to know something.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the weather like outside? Do a quick check of your weather app. Who the heck is Gabriel Garcia Marquez? Ask Wikipedia. Who is the lead boy actor in Wes Anderson&#8217;s Moonrise Kingdom? Search <span class="caps">IMDB.</span>com. Google, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, et al will tell you anything you want to know, right now.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that incredible? Just 20 years ago, that was unthinkable. If you wanted to know something, you might turn on the TV and hope to get lucky, or look in your encyclopedias (if you had them) and hope to get lucky, or go to the library and hope to get lucky. Most of the time, you had to settle on not knowing.</p>

<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve noticed from <a href="http://zenhabits.net/offline/">turning off my computer</a> periodically throughout the day (I work in 30-minute chunks), is that when the computer is off, I often think of a question I want answered &#8212; and my first instinct is to go to the computer and search. I&#8217;d know in like 4 seconds!</p>

<p>But then I pause, and examine that urge. Is it a true need, to know right now? Can I not wait 30 minutes, or even a few hours, or a day? Of course I can. It&#8217;s not a matter of life or death, or national security, or anything important really.</p>

<p>And so I stop myself, and make a note to look it up later. Then I notice something else interesting: not knowing is a strange phenomena to me, now. Not knowing is something I am not familiar with. <span class="caps">OK, </span>sure, there are a gazillion things I don&#8217;t know, every moment of my life, but when I want to know something, I will usually know, really really quickly. Now I don&#8217;t know something I want to know, for at least half an hour, sometimes more.</p>

<p>And then I realize: this is a strange freedom. Not knowing something means I am walking around blind, without a direct path, and I must live with that, work with that. It&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s a different way of living. How our ancestors must have lived! (Or, you know, me in the early 90s.)</p>

<p>Not knowing isn&#8217;t bad. It&#8217;s just different. And really, I think there&#8217;s something minimalist about it. Let&#8217;s let go of the need to know, every second of the day, and let our minds wander around in the dark for abit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people don&#8217;t do minimalism because it doesn&#8217;t seem realistic for their lives. But what they often mean is that they don&#8217;t want others to think they&#8217;re weird.</p>

<p>Wearing the same clothes every day might seem weird to your friends and co-workers. Having no car might make you seem like an oddball. Not having a smartphone might make you uncool. Living in a <a href="http://rowdykittens.com/our-tiny-house/">small home</a> or <a href="http://tynan.com/living-in-a-small-rv-introduction">an RV</a> might make everyone think you&#8217;re poor or crazy. Eating vegan food might make the meat eaters in your life groan or roll their eyes.</p>

<p>But who are we living for? I am all for living to help other people, but when we live our lives to the expectations of other people, we end up living lives we don&#8217;t want. And what do we get when we live up to the expectations of all these other people? They really don&#8217;t care &#8212; they just don&#8217;t like things different because they are uncomfortable with change. Staying the same as everyone else doesn&#8217;t make everyone else happier &#8212; it just doesn&#8217;t force them to reflect on their lives.</p>

<p>Where do these expectations come from, anyway? Other people didn&#8217;t just make them up &#8212; they are customs built up over the years, often very consciously by corporations trying to get us into expensive buying habits. For example, we have so many clothes, gadgets and other possessions because ads have sold us on the idea that we need clothing to look stylish, to be successful, to feel like a woman, to be as good as the people on <span class="caps">TV.</span> It wasn&#8217;t always this way, and it&#8217;s up to us to decide whether we want it to be that way from now on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying we should go live in the woods and ignore society (though that&#8217;s not a bad option). I live in society, and yet no one minds me wearing the same clothes all the time. People don&#8217;t go wild with anger when they hear that I&#8217;m not buying Christmas presents. I might get a raised eyebrow when they find out I don&#8217;t have cable TV or a car, and I might have to explain myself when they hear I&#8217;m a vegan, but no one gets mad at me and they go on with their lives. I sure go on with mine.</p>

<p>The way everyone else does things isn&#8217;t working. People aren&#8217;t happy with a life filled with possessions. Driving cars all the time adds to stress, makes people unhealthier, pollutes. People get unhealthy with their standard American diet. Just because everyone else thinks this is the way it should be done, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the best way. Go against the stream &#8212; the other fish don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;re going either!</p>

<p>When it comes to others, be helpful, compassionate, grateful. But don&#8217;t live up to their expectations. You&#8217;ll be freed of the shackles of meaningless customs, so that you can live as you want.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe I&#8217;m as happy as it is possible to be.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not crying out in ecstatic pleasure, or streaming tears of joy, but I am very happy. It&#8217;s not a peak of happiness, but a plateau of happiness that can go on for as long as I live.</p>

<p>This is a happiness I wish on everyone alive. The question then is, what are the factors that contribute to my happiness?</p>

Here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t have:<br />
<ol>
	<li>A huge house</li>
	<li>Massive wealth</li>
	<li>Fancy clothes</li>
	<li>A nice car</li>
	<li>A powerful job</li>
	<li>Cable TV</li>
</ol>
And I don&#8217;t believe having any of those would contribute to greater happiness than I already have.

Here&#8217;s what I do have that contribute to my happiness:<br />
<ol>
	<li>Time</li>
	<li>Loving relationships</li>
	<li>Meaningful work</li>
	<li>Health</li>
	<li>Books</li>
	<li>Enough</li>
</ol>
The first six are seen as the goals of society by many people. The second six make me very happy, and I believe I have them because I decided to forgo the first six. I recommend this path.]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We strive to improve our lives, often because we are dissatisfied with how things are. I know this, because I&#8217;ve lived it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like the way I look, so I try to improve myself. I don&#8217;t like my house, so I work to get a better one. I want everyone around me to improve too, so I push them to change, and get frustrated when they won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This striving never ends. When we are unsatisfied with how things are, including ourselves, we make changes, but then what? We are still unsatisfied, because the root cause of this problem isn&#8217;t the things around us (or how we look, etc.), but our expectations. We expect things to be different.</p>

<p>This means we are always unhappy in some way. Things don&#8217;t meet our expectations. We try to correct this problem by changing the world around us, trying to get others to change, trying to change ourselves. Our compulsion to spend, to consume, to buy more stuff &#8230; it&#8217;s rooted in this as well. And so minimalism is an attempt to fix the compulsion, but that can really only be done once we address the root problem: our expectations.</p>

<p>Sit for a minute and look at the things around you. Are you happy with them, or would you like things to change? Think about what you do each day, and ask if you&#8217;re happy with your daily life, or if you&#8217;d like change. Think about the people in your life, and ask if you&#8217;re happy with them, or if you&#8217;d like them to change. Think about yourself, and see if there are things you&#8217;re dissatisfied with, if you&#8217;d like to change yourself.</p>

<p>Now, for each thing you think needs change, try sitting for a minute and see if you can simply accept each one, as they are right now. See if you can accept each person in your life for who they are, exactly as they are. See if you can accept your body for what it is, without the need for change. It takes practice, so if you aren&#8217;t good at it at first (and I&#8217;m still not a master at it myself), practice. It&#8217;s an enlightening process, to be sure.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll never change anything. We can develop healthy habits and make our bodies healthier over time, but we can do that while also being happy with who we already are. Change is inevitable, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily require that we not accept things as they are, that we not be happy with things as they already are.</p>

<p>Once we become happy with things, people, and ourselves &#8230; as they are &#8230; we can become whole, without the need to spend money to fill a hole in our lives. Then minimalism becomes a possibility, because once we are OK with things as they are, we can simply strip away the unnecessary, and be content with little.</p>]]></content:encoded>
